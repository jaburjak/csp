# Cutting Stock Problem

Cutting Stock Problem (CSP) deals with planning the cutting of rods from given stock items.

- This implementation of CSP tries to answer \
_How to minimize number of stock items used while cutting customer order?_
- While doing so, it also optimizes for \
_How to cut the stock for customer orders so that waste is minimum?_

## Quick start

Clone this project and install required packages:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:jaburjak/csp.git
$ cd csp
$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To solve your Cutting Stock Problem, run the `stock_cutter_1d.py` file:

```sh
(env) $ python csp/stock_cutter_1d.py infile.txt
```

Output:

```jsonc
{
    "statusName": "OPTIMAL",
    "numSolutions": 1,
    "numUniqueSolutions": 1,
    "numRollsUsed": 5,
    "solutions": [
    	[
            // [unused_stock_width, [item_width...]]
            [0, [3400, 500, 500, 500, 220, 220, 220, 220, 220]],
            [80, [500, 500, 500, 500, 220, 1850, 1850]],
            [10, [220, 220, 1850, 1850, 1850]],
            [90, [3400, 220, 220, 220, 1850]],
            [880, [3400, 500, 500, 500, 220]]
        ]
    ]
}
```

### Using the input file

The first number in the input file must be the stock width followed by requested item widths. Numbers should be separated by whitespace.

## Libraries
* [Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization)

## Limitations
* Works with integers only. If you have some values that have decimal part, you can multiply all of your inputs with some number that will make them integers (or close estimation).
